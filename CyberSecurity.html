      <h4><b>CLIENT:</b> Standard Bank <br>
        <b>TYPE:</b> Brand identity   |   Design campaign   |   User journey</h4>
      <h4><b>About the project:</b>
        <p>With cyber attacks on the rise, the need to protect personal information and data security of a 158-year-old financial institution became increasingly critical to onboarding new users, retaining existing ones and maintain credibility as a financial services provider.</p>
        <h4><b>My role:</b>
          <p>I created the brand identity and group cyber campaigns with multiple-user touch points.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>How might we address the lack of cyber skills within the organisation and define vulnerabilities by looking into details of how cyber attacks occur and learn how they take place from the beginning to the end?</h2><br>

      <h4><b>Problem space scenarios</b></h4>
      <p>As cybersecurity itself is a multi-faceted discipline, I chose to document the main insights to deepen my understanding of the challenges and imagine the pain points of users in each scenario of the cyberspace as an entry point into design.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Defense:</b> What methods and mechanisms are currently used to defend against cyberattacks?
        <li><b>Frameworks:</b> Is there dedicated guidance and curriculum on approaches to cybersecurity?
        <li><b>Response:</b> What are the various responses to cyberattacks and is it effective?
        <li><b>Certification:</b> How can we test and validate the knowledge and expertise of our practitioners?
      </ol>
      <h2>"There's just never enough time to upskill and learn something new"</h2>
      <h4><b>Aligning user goals and touchpoints</b></h4>
      <p>With insights now available into the current experience, I developed 3 personas and formulated touchpoints that they would interact at various points through design.</p>

    <div>
      <h4><b>The solution</b></h4>
      <p>An e-learning academy was specifically created to focus on the human and business factors in cybersecurity. With a pre-select process, participants were identified and invited to go through advanced training, where they would be issued with electronic stamps or badges as each component was completed. This would ultimately enable them to help understand the organisations needs and to remotely secure and enable the bank's clients.<br>

      <h4><b>Success and learnings</b></h4>
      <p>The notable success of this particular project meant that we could do change management of other important campaigns quite effectively within the Group related to the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013  and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Drawing on user empathy helped me to clarify business requirements and objectives better so that I could translate the findings into creative campaigns that created much needed impact.</p>
