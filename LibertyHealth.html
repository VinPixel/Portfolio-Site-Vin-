      <h4><b>CLIENT:</b> Liberty Health <br>
        <b>TYPE:</b> Design | UX | UI
      </h4>
      <h4><b>About the project:</b>
        <p>The current member card needed a redesign, so I used this opportunity to understand the challenges, refine the user journey and redesign UI to link the card to the mobile app and create a seamless user experience.</p>
        <h4><b>My role:</b>
          <p>I designed the card, managed quality production processes and timelines from start to finish. Redesigning UI screens aligned to refreshed brand CI illustrated how the card linked to the app. Auditing the existing process down to the very
            beginning helped me to understand and prioritise critical issues so that a better experience could be delivered.</p>

      <h4><b>The Problem</b></h4>
      <p>The present card was average in quality and ID card printers used in-country to print details provided inconsistent and poor results. This negated achieving a unified user experience through the integrity of the card as there was also no one
        unified pattern that helped to gather data across the system to load and track claims as well mitigate the risk of fraud.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li><b>User challenges:</b> A lack of structure, timelines and quality control created a completely disjointed experience where users did not receive the cards on time, or sometimes not at all due to border delays.
        <li><b>User goals:</b> Clarifying goals with the product team helped to align the overall design of the new card to the user journey by linking the member card to the app to submit and track claims online.
      </ol>
      <h2>Helping the user get the most out of the experience</h2>
      <h4><b>Getting the user journey right</b></h4>

      <h4><b>Final solution</b></h4>
      <p>By engaging stakeholders, a well structured and compliant process via Service Level Agreements (SLAs) were put in place to design, produce and delivery a member card with an onboarding letter, folded into a mailing solution with window
        envelope on time. As an extension to the experience, additional UI screens were designed to show how the card would link to the app. This was done in an effort to build on how the claims process could be automated and tracked online.<br>

      <h4><b>Prototyping</b></h4>
      <p>By drawing low-fidelity screens in Axure, I could map out interaction and establish tap and swipe gestures for users. I was able to load this onto mobile and test by recruiting a few users around me to get feedback on how users could link
        their product number and benefit via the cards to the app in the fewest amount of clicks.</p>

      <h4><b>Final design</b></h4>
      <p>The final layout was set up in Adobe XD providing brand guidance on the Corporate Identity and using iOS human interface guidelines. My objective was to keep iconography simple and microcopy understandable. Using familiar UI elements would
        allow for users to draw on familiar behaviours and patterns from their own mobile app usage.</p>

      <h4><b>Inclusive design</b></h4>
      <p>Designing for the blind and visually impaired by including braille type affords good accessibility. Using voice notes would also make for a useful containment strategy in and getting vital information to those who need it. </p>

      <h4><b>Learnings</b></h4>
      <p>Integrating a physical product with a digital product has provided valuable Insights into how features and functions need to be designed makes testing is effective and handover to developers efficient. This approach to problem solving helps
        me to address future projects with a user-centric mindset.</p>
