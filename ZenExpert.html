      <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
      <p>Today, with countless 'how-to videos' and unverified sources of information circulating, how do we reaffirm trust in credible sources of information in order to solve a real problem?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
      <p>The goal of this app is to give people a simple, intuitive way to connect with an expert in nearly any field within seconds, so they can feel more informed and more prepared to face their everyday (and not-so-everyday) problems. The app will
        be free to use, and will require payment for any video calls done over the platform.</p>

    <div>
      <h4>METHOD AND APPROACH</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Qualitative data measured in rich emotional detail - Surveys, User interviews, Card sorting, Affinity maps
        <li>User interaction with an end-to-end experience and how it makes them feel - User personas Customer journeys
        <li>The way in which a user perform tasks in order to achieve a specific goal - Task analysis and Sitemaps
        <li>Sketching frames and developing high-fidelity screens to emulate functionality - Wireframes and Prototyping
        <li>Observe, document and analyse users' processes and workarounds to improve usability - Usability Testing
      </ol>

      <h2>So, where is the need and who is creating it?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h4>
      <p>By using the voice of the user and data, that while expert help, you may not exactly find what you need, when you need and yet, still have to pay for it. I found experts to be inactive, have inadequate profile information, low-user ratings
        and poor search functionality–all of which could affect trust levels and impact on users decisions. For users who need to quickly locate, verify and utilise credible and well-categorised information, this would frustrate them, with little to
        make an informed decision and ultimately abandon the experience.</p>

    <div>
      <h4>KEY FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS</h4>
      <p>Testing assumptions via surveys and interviews on users who demonstrated a heavy reliance on their mobile devices to get things done and allowed me to reveal the following attitudes and behaviours:</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Who are we designing for?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>USER PERSONAS</h4>
      <p>From 5 interviews and 22 surveys, I observed patterns that represented potentially 4 different personas–2 students and 2 teachers. For the purpose of this activity, a knowledge seeker and a knowledge expert was pursued to align what they
        experienced and how it made them feel in order to start identifying features and functions for the solution.</p>

      </picture>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>USER JOURNEYS</h4>
      <p>Mental models gave me valuable insights into the complexity of human nature and cognitive behaviours. This provided a window into the mind of my two unique users, allowing me to see what they fundamentally think about and how they behave in
        order to satisfy the basic need of acquiring bespoke information.</p>

      </picture>
    </div>
    <h4>TASK ANALYSIS AND USER FLOW</h4>
    <p>Differentiating entry points and success criteria for my knowledge seeker and provider were illustrated in linear steps and how they successfully get to their end points. User flows build on the pathways designed for persona experience at
      hand. Understanding how unique my users are meant I could now develop functions and features suited to create a solution that is easy to use (efficient) and able to solve a real problem securely (effective).</p>

      </picture>
      <p><b>Discovery:</b> By regularly updating and auditing the sitemap, this helped to clarify personas and one of the core components of the app–the communication between knowledge seeker and knowledge provider as well as the drive for additional
        features. Given more time, an open card sort would have useful to provide insights into how users find ways for search engines to assist them in locating expert advice.</p>

      <h4>TRANSLATING STRATEGY INTO DESIGN</h4>

        </picture>
        <p><b>Design and Prototyping:</b> Going from simple, low to mid-fidelity prototypes with low interaction allowed me to validate concept while polishing high-fidelity aesthetically pleasing screens for users to test what they liked and
          disliked.</p>
        <p><b>Low-fidelity wireframes:</b> Sketching the starting point allowed me to check against the overall concept in Balsamiq and Axure. I was able to understand how the wireframes emulate functionality and help to map out the product.
        <p><b>Mid-fidelity wireframes:</b>Building mid-fidelity versions to illustrate a better understanding of the visual properties and behaviours of assets and revealed insights into user's learned behaviours. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel.
        <p><b>High-fidelity wireframes:</b>Functionality and greater detail went into building the interface using Sketch for user interaction to tap and swipe into position. Users preferred the aesthetically rich and almost final experience.<br>
        <p><b>Discovery:</b> Mixed-fidelity prototypes helped to identify and position key colours and test contrast. In addition to cue and response method that user's were familiar with, I wanted to build conversation between the user and app so
          that they would remember the experience.</p>

      </div>
      <h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
      <p>Card sorting clarified and aligned attitudes and behaviours to validate user personas in an effort to fix problems user's experienced in navigation, features and parts of the site structure to be retested. As a result, I also found the need
        to
        relabeled and changed microcopy so that user's didn't feel confused or felt that the app created ambiguity.</p>

      <p><b>Error 1: Severity: 4</b> Users did not appreciate the app attempting to solicit their private information. They felt they weren't given a choice.
        <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Onboarding was converted to a friendly and trustworthy experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Error 2: Severity: 4</b> Users expected more guidance and reluctantly signed-in to find a simple dashboard that did not grab their attention.
        <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Aesthetic redesign on UI screens helped to hold users interest.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Error 3: Severity: 3</b> Users experienced challenges using the search filter function and felt it could be better developed. Contrast and good spacing encouraged them to make use of the function.
        <br><b>Recommendation:</b> An intuitive and user-friendly search function with filter was designed to help users locate the appropriate results.​​​​
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Error 4: Severity: 3</b> More clicks than users needed and flow of screens posed a challenge for users. They simply needed to change an appointment with ease and lessen frustration.
        <br><b>Recommendation:</b> Revised screens with fewer clicks so users can now decide upfront on a voice or video-call and confirmation a call.

    <div>
      <p><b>Onboarding Screen: Categories</b> Variating key colours of UI elements in Screens A and B, saw preference shift in users over the average time period with the assumption that blue may is trusted for its extensive use in transactional
        consumer e-services.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Onboarding Screen: Home</b> A primary and optimal search function was preferred over an 'add funds' icon which seemed to still prove invasive to users as they wanted to create their own experience to make a final decision based on how
        secure they felt the experience was.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>IS IT READY TO LAUNCH?</h4>
      <h5>Discovery</h5>
      <p><b>Testing mixed-fidelity prototypes </b> is more effective earlier on in the process and great at testing assumptions about how people will use product which is different to how they actually use product. In this case, I made the app more
        conversational, so that I could be aware of user's relationship with the app through applying high-definition design.</p>
      <p><b>Using a structured method to record and collate over 2 hours of data </b> on a spreadsheet to see whether participants acted in a way I had expected, creates value summarising and validating assumptions to improve the solution.</p>
      <p><b>Good understanding and application of UI principles </b> is imperative to clarify and assist users in wayfinding. Getting lost is frustrating and even more for people with visual impairment and age-related illnesses.</p>
      <p>And finally, <b> catch the mistakes sooner </b> so that users don't give up on the experience.

      <h4>SERENE, TRUSTWORTHY AND INVITING</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Chosen as one of the popular colours used in business and financial services, blue is based as the colour of trust, calm and friendliness, helping me to understand its adoption by Facebook and Twitter. Versatile, vibrant and contrasting for
        use in iconography, background colour and navigation.

      <h4>ICONOGRAPHY</h4>
      <div>
        <p>ZenExpert icons are used to communicate with and help guide users through an experience. Using a 32 pixel grid, pixel-perfect icons aligned elements to achieve tap targets for mobile.</p>

      <div>
        <h4>GRID LAYOUT AND TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
        <div>
          <p>To facilitate order and understanding and for users, a 6-column vertical adaptive grid layout keeps it simple for all content types. Versatile font stacks like SF Pro Display and SF Pro Text offer familiarity as well as the control and
            flexibility of text display text at various sizes, and weights in many different languages, across multiple interfaces.</p>

          <h4>Usability</h4>
          <p>To remind myself constantly, “how would this make a user feel” or “who is this being designed for?”, encourages empathy and ongoing learning around usability. Testing my assumptions and validating personas resulted in constructive
            changes for users.</p>
          <h4>Tools</h4>
          <p>Consistent patterns of design promoted learning and memorability as I familiarised myself using industry tools with good user interfaces to accelerate my own learning.</p>
          <h4>Testing</h4>
          <p>Testing often means an opportunity to improve the experience. Understanding how two users will never yield the same result and asking open-ended questions while listening intently to users reveal how and why a system or their own
            tentativeness may hinder them.</p>
          <h4>Accessibility</h4>
          <p>As a UX Practitioner, I can remove the barriers that people with disabilities encounter by understanding and consistently designing for their needs during the entire process.</p><br>
